        Story of Ryan Widgeon: 200k Facebook/Airbnb job in 4 easy steps
      </title>
      <b>Tl;dr</b>
      <span>1. Lie on your resume</span>
      <span>2. Convince someone to do your Facebook/Airbnb interview</span>
      <span>3. ???</span>
      <span>4. Profit!</span>

      <div class="caption">Picture of Ryan</div>
      <b>Why am I writing this?</b>
      <span
        >To expose Ryan Widgeon and the flaws in the practices that companies
        use. Ryan Widgeon and his actions diminishes all the work that another
        person has done to achieve the same feat. The fact that he’s actually
        incapable of doing the work is what makes it even worse. I’m also
        disgusted by the lack of responsibility taken by Google, Facebook, and
        Airbnb.</span
      >
      <b>Lying on your resume</b>
      <span
        >You’ve always heard the stories about how you should never lie on your
        resume. You’ll be found out. That turns out to be a lie (with
        exceptions)!</span
      >
      <span
        >You can’t lie about easily verifiable information such as a college
        degrees. So what do you lie about? Past employer history. It turns out
        it’s hard to coerce this information from previous employers due to
        privacy issues.</span
      >
      <span
        >How do I know this? Well….Ryan Widgeon submitted his resume with a
        Google Practicum (now STEP) internship listed to both Facebook and
        Airbnb. Did he work at Google? No!</span
      >
      <span
        >I have <b>reasonable doubt</b> that he did not work at Google. A couple
        of friends who work at Google could not find any internal project
        documentation or presence of him working there. To add to that he’s told
        various people different things. For example, Ryan Widgeon would tell a
        person that he interned at Google Flights, then tell another person that
        he was doing a scholarship program for Google. A recruiter also revealed
        to me that Google Flights has never had an intern.</span
      >
      <span
        >Another piece of evidence is that he actually was in school at the time
        taking PHY2048 - Physics 1 in person. So there was no possible way for
        him to be at the Google campus and school at the same time!</span
      >
      <span
        >This all isn’t substantial proof, so I contacted a recruiter and HR at
        Google in an attempt to verify this information. I received a response
        that stated for privacy reasons that they aren’t able to disclose this
        information. I then replied asking that they at least take action on
        that information and inform Ryan to at least remove it from his LinkedIn
        profile. They again said that they are unable to take action.</span

      <b>Convince someone to do your Facebook/Airbnb interview</b>
      <span
        >Knowing Ryan Widgeon personally, I know for a fact that he could not
        pass Google, Facebook, and Airbnb interviews. When Ryan Widgeon revealed
        that he was going to be interning at Airbnb and Facebook, I was
        absolutely shocked and believed for a minute that he was not as
        technically challenged as I thought he was. This was all until an
        acquittance of mine revealed that he was the one that did the interviews
        for Ryan Widgeon. This person in question was in a dark place at the
        time and sought friendship through Ryan Widgeon. Although this does not
        justify my acquittance’s actions, I thought some context should be
        given. Ryan Widgeon exploited this “friendship” and convinced him to do
        his interview.</span
      >
      <span>This was reported to Airbnb and Facebook.</span>
      <span
        >No action was taken by either company because there was “not enough
        evidence”. This was due to the fact that interviews are not recorded and
        that they don’t require candidates to have their webcam on when
        interviewing.</span
      >
      <span
        >Facebook even stated that Ryan Widgeon would come out in the wash by
        the end of the internship and be caught in his inability to perform.
        However, that misses the point and that Ryan Widgeon would still
        ultimately benefit from having Facebook or Airbnb’s brand on his
        resume.</span
      >
      <span
        >And what’s to say that he couldn’t “convince” another person to write
        the code during his internship for a cut of the money to get a return
        offer. The amount that an intern at Facebook makes is not little either.
        Interns at Facebook make $24,000 for the length of their internship (12
        weeks). This doesn’t include the corporate housing / housing stipend
        that Facebook provides too.</span
      >
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <span
        >This ultimately boils down to companies inability to verify past
        employment history (maybe limited to internships) and not verifying a
        candidate during an interview. This allows these malicious acts to take
        place and takes away opportunities from other candidates that deserve
        it.</span
      >
      <span
        >Although I am unable to provide strong evidence against Ryan Widgeon, I
        am telling this story in the hopes that companies improve their
        recruiting processes and actually take actions against these
        individuals.</span
